## Project Overview:
We intend to create several models to predict academic achievement based off the various factors we find are most influential. We will run analysis on the data and provide some visualizations. We will deploy our findings on Heroku and include a form where the user can input new data that will run through our model and predict the grade score.

## Data:

Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). Each contains student acedemic performance and contributing factors including age, sex, parental education level, study time, and various other demographic and social attributes (30 in total). The data was aqcuired using school reports and student questionaires for two schools in Portugal. We combined the two datasets (total of 1044 rows) to create machine learning models and visualizations.
